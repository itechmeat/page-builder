# Summary
Implement a drag’n’drop application within which you can add, move and sort placeholders (as shown with dotted line on the sketch) that can contain text or picture at a certain layout.

### Requirements
- [x] Create a simple application within which it is possible to add new placeholder elements in the existing layout.
- [ ] Initially, the layout has no placeholders.
- [x] Enable adding an arbitrary number of placeholders in the layout.
- [x] Adding and moving/sorting placeholders is enabled with the use of drag’n’drop.
- [x] The first placeholder on the layout is always acting like it is bigger than all the rest.
- [ ] Each placeholder it is possible then to add one textual element OR one picture.
- [ ] It is possible to remove the text or picture from the placeholder element.
- [ ] Add readme.txt file with your assignment solution.

### Extra task
- [x] Implement erasing of placeholders, so it can be pulled to the “trash-bin” icon.
- [x] If the placeholder is pulled to any other place within the interface, it needs to go back to place it was before.
- [x] After erasing the placeholder, it is necessary to update the order of other placeholders (for example, if the first placeholder was deleted, the second placeholder steps in its place, the third one steps on the second placeholder etc.).

### Recommendations
- [x] Use Vue.js
- [ ] It is allowed to use other existing libraries.
- [x] For stylisation of the interface we recommend that you use SCSS.
- [x] The overall design does not have to be polished, we will give more attention to the structure and CSS naming.
